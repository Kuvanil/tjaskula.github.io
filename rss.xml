      <description>&lt;div class="row"&gt;
&lt;div class="medium-8 columns"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started to think about what title would best fit my new blog, I was stuck. I couldn't find anything that really translated the state of my mind. I wanted it to be short but also communicative. Something, that when you read it you already have an idea of what kind of content you can find on this blog. Still nothing on my mind...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
